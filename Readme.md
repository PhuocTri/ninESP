# Introduction

ninESP is a modular firmware for ESP8266 SoC based on SmingFramework.
It is designed to work with a few kinds of sensors which you can attach to it
and then it acts as an MQTT Client. So you can easily switch relays or simply as a
relay server for RC Plugs (All RCSwitch compatible Plugs and Protocols) or just a
timer based MQTT publish of sensor values. Also it can start an UDP Server to act/react
for most of the peripherals.

Everything should be accessible and especially configurable from a simple webinterface.
The Webinterface based on the NetworkConfig Example of the SmingFramework.

On first run it starts a Wifi Accesspoint from itself with name "ninHome Configuration"
which you can connect from any Wifi enabled device and then connect with a webbrowser
to "http://192.168.4.1" to get into the webinterface.
There you can first configure the Wifi it should connect to, the mqtt settings and the 
connected periphals and the corresponding mqtt topics.
After you configured your ninESP you can find the current IP Address on the defined LWT MQTT 
Topic when the client is online, if it disconnects it will just say "Offline" in the LWT Topic.

In Version 0.2 the library for the MAX7219 control changed to a more modern and flexible
library which can do a lot of more animations. 
MD_MAX72xx and MD_Parola which are from [MajicDesigns](https://github.com/MajicDesigns) 
Since this version (0.2) your flash size has to be at least a 1M type. 

The firmware itself should be mostly compatible to the closed source firmware for the
inwall esp8266 which you can buy on ebay.

You can find the latest firmware version in a binary format in the firmware folder in the root of this repository

# Known Working Boards/Chips

Here you find a list of development boards and modules which are known to work with ninESP firmware.
ESP-201 Modules will work but some of them are only manufactured with an 512k flash so it is too small
for the ninESP firmware.

<table border="1" align="center" width="80%">
<tr><th>Board / Module</th><th>Working state</th></tr>
<tr><td>WeMos D1 mini clone<br>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/ninharp/ninESP/master/doc/boards/WEMOSD1c.jpg" alt="wemosd1"></td><td>works</td></tr>

# Dependencies

The project relies on SmingFramework for ESP8266, the SmingFramework is as submodule added but not the 
[esp-open-sdk](https://github.com/pfalcon/esp-open-sdk) , which you had to install also and by yourself.
As other submodules are the libraries of MajicDesigns included.
[MD_MAX72xx](https://github.com/MajicDesigns/MD_MAX72XX) - MAX72xx Driver Library
[MD_Parola](https://github.com/MajicDesigns/MD_Parola) - Animation Library for MAX72XX

~~It uses a slightly modified version of the SmingFramework MQTTClient Class, cause i needed
some small additions to that.~~

# Serial Commands

You can interact with the firmware via the serial terminal and a baudrate of 115200baud

# Flashing to your board

If you just want to flash the firmware without the compiling, you can take one of our binary releases from the firmware folder in the repository. 
There are zip archives with the firmware files in it. 
Its not one file builds so you have to flash it seperately. The flash addresses are the file names of the binaries.
Except of the spiff rom, which had to be in this case on memory address *0x5A000*. 
An example flashing command with esptool could look like this.

```esptool.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 230400 write_flash -ff 40m -fm qio -fs 32m 0x00000 0x00000.bin 0xa000 0xa000.bin 0x5A000 spiff_rom.bin```

# FAQ

*Q. My MAX7219 Displays are mirrored or just displaying crap, what can i do?*
A. Look in the MAX72XX Submodule folder and open the MAX72xx.h in edit mode and
    search for the MAX7219 module settings. There you can change the type of module you got
    and will hopefully fix the displaying issue.
    
*Q. The firmware want compile, it says "error: 'typedef' was ignored in this declaration"*
A. Apply the MD_Parola.patch from the repositorys root folder.
Or remove the "typedef" tag from MD_Parola.h by yourself

*Q. Can i see or download the configuration files for later use?*
A. You can see or download the configuration files in json format if you open
http://YOUR_ESP_IP/dumpcfg?type=TYPE 
and TYPE can be *mqtt*, *network* or *periph*
